# fancy-tips-calculator
This project is a simple app useful for calculating a tip at a restaurant

A user begins by entering the total bill amount for their tab. Then, a slider for adjusting tip percentage fades in. Totals are calculated as a user adjusts the slider or edits billField.

Time spent: 10 hours. 

Completed user stories:

• Required: functional billField input, tip amount, and relevant calculations.

• Optional: UISlider allowing user to select precise tip amount 

• Optional: Fade in secondary UI and information onEditingChanged 

• Optional: Calculations for splitting bill between two, three, and four persons

• Optional: Custom layout, launch image, app icon, color scheme, and fonts


Notes:
In future commits for this project, expect me to figure out how to prevent deleting the dollar sign in billField, prevent adding digits in front of the dollar sign in billField, and a nifty animation of the billField moving from the center of the screen to the top of the screen onEditingChanged.
